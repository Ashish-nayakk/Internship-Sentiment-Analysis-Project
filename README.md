Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Posts

AI & ML Internship Major Project — InternsElite (May–July 2025)

This project analyzes the sentiment of social media text (Positive, Negative, Neutral) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. It was developed as the major project during my AI & ML (with Python) Internship at InternsElite, completed from 4th May 2025 to 24th July 2025.

🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning–based sentiment classifier capable of processing raw text and predicting the underlying sentiment.
This includes:

Data cleaning and NLP preprocessing

Converting text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization

Training machine learning classification models

Evaluating accuracy and performance

Predicting sentiment for new, unseen text

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (

) as part of the internship requirements.

🧠 Features Implemented

✔ Text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords filtering)
✔ Tokenization
✔ TF-IDF feature extraction
✔ ML model training (Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / SVM)
✔ Accuracy evaluation
✔ Sentiment prediction on custom inputs
✔ End-to-end workflow inside the notebook

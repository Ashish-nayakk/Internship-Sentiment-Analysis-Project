📘 Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Posts

AI & ML Internship Major Project – InternsElite (May–July 2025)

This repository contains a complete Sentiment Analysis system that classifies social media posts into Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiment using both Traditional Machine Learning and Transformer-based Deep Learning (BERTweet).

The project was developed as part of my AI & ML Internship (with Python) at InternsElite, completed from 4th May 2025 – 24th July 2025.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on social media text using two different approaches:

🔹 1. Classical NLP + Machine Learning

Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopwords)

TF-IDF feature extraction

ML classifiers: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM

Accuracy comparison & evaluation

🔹 2. Transformer-Based Deep Learning (BERTweet)

HuggingFace model:
finiteautomata/bertweet-base-sentiment-analysis

AutoTokenizer + AutoModelForSequenceClassification

Sentiment pipeline for real-world social media text

GPU support (if available)

This combination demonstrates how both ML and modern NLP transformers can be applied to the same problem.

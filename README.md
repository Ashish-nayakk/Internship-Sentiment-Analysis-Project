An end-to-end Sentiment Analysis project that classifies social media text into Positive, Negative, or Neutral sentiment using NLP techniques and machine learning. Implemented during my AI &amp; ML Internship at InternsElite (May–July 2025). Project includes data preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and a working demo.
